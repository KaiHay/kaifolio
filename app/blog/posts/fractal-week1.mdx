Coding is getting fun for me again!

Started this week well doing functionality, but then quickly realized I sucked at styling no matter the method I was using. Got a lot better at tailwind over the week, but started off basically from 0.

With functionality, I was doing pretty well, but towards the end, I wasn't understanding completely how to use sockets and implement live updating. I am still a bit blocked on that end, but I have the idea of how to restructure my code and create the proper methods to do it.

I've found that with the help of the instructors, I'm not stuck on some obscure bug for 3 hours and I am able to more quickly find what is not a bug to narrow down to what is. 

One thing I disliked so much about coding in university was that I'd be completely stuck for several hours because of bugs I couldn't find. Even when seeking help from my peers it would just complicate things even more because they had their own unique/plagiarized implementation which they didn't completely understand. I guess in a way school had almost encouraged people to copy just so they wouldn't run into unique issues.
