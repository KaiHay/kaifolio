Started this week kind of sick. I was working slow and felt pretty slow picking up/comprehending things. I took a sick day and I felt terrible. I was torn between "I'm not that sick, I should be doing all the work that I am missing" and "I'm so tired and my brain can't comprehend anything." I don't know, sick of being sick. 

When I came back, I was still feeling sick, but kind of wired. I was going through the content quickly and implementing things that I thought were cool. I really enjoyed auth for some reason. I just like hooking up the related tables and its cool doing queries with keys from other tables.

I'm still working on getting better at styling. Sometimes I have this image of how I want things to be layed out in my head, but it's really difficult for me to actually make it look like that, probably how artists feel. 

Overall, good end to a terrible start, but I might still need to do some catching up.
