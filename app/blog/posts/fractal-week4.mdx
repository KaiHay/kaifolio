summary:'How do I get motivated'

What motivates me to code? Recently, I've been struggling with motivating myself to finish up projects and get to +95% done. For the first 75% of the projects I genuinly enjoy coding. I feel like I'm learning and making progress on what I'm doing, but when I get to the last 20%, I just get blocked. Not necessarily blocked by knowledge, but more so my mind. I just start sitting there thinking about what I have to do. I sit there thinking about how I don't want to do the 20%. I think about how I essentially completed the thing and have a functional project, it just doesn't look/display well. It feels like I have this giant list of tiny changes I have to make to get to the 100, but its like all these menial tasks that add up. In my head I think, "Wow this button now has rounded corners and moves! I did so much! /s." So how do I motivate myself to push through the last 25% when I feel like I'm not really learning much and like I'm not moving big concepts. 

Andrew helped give me good insight into that and how I feel. He asked me what motives me to code at all. I like doing the backend stuff because it feel like I'm learning and producing functional stuff. So what motivates me when thats not there. MONEY. Where does the money come from? When would you get payed? THE LAST 95-100% COMPLETION. When Andrew told me that, it made me mad. I was mad that he was right. I was mad that I could literally picture that list of ui changes and see them having bounties on them. Whatever, I'll just be mad when I have to do the last 20% and use it as motivation.
