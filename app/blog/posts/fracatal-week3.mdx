How do i work. When everything is somewhat structured I kind of just go with the flow and do the work. I don't think about what I'm doing, I just do it and forget. I don't think about what the next steps will be or how far I will be able to get. The finish line is already defined for me. With freedom and just an abstract idea, I found that I started to think and plan and learn. Before this, I've never really fully written a plan for myself to follow. Starting without one I felt lost and would ramble in my own head about the different things that could be done and should be done. I’ve lost so much time doing that and didn’t want that anymore.

My work mindset has always been to get the thing working. Without a plan, I found it hard to focus on the pieces that were essential. I would think, 'A' needs 'B' so should I do 'A' first but 'A' needs 'C' but 'C' doesn't really do anything without other stuff. And I would go into an infinite loop and not get stuff done. With a plan I found myself working in a really modular way. I would do things component by component and if it depended on other stuff, I would find a way to hardcode/fill in the needed stuff. It felt like I was building lego blocks and eventually connecting them together. Idk it was a really up and down week in terms of how much progress I was making and felt like I was making. Overall I really enjoyed learning how I work with myself and what motivates me to work. Also chopping the things down so small where I feel like if I’m not doing them then I’m stupid.
